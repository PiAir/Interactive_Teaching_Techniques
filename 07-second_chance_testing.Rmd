# Second Chance Testing 

Note: term grading schemes should be adjusted to avoid undue grade inflation

## Déjà vu

Let students know the next class period they will be given the IDENTICAL test they just took, and create time for them to discuss in groups what they answered and why. The second test will also be taken by individuals.

## Fake First Grade

Give all students 100% on first grade to bolster confidence and appreciation, but also provide what their REAL score would have been, as well as details about how to improve.

## 80/20 Rule

Students know to expect a second test right after the first one, with 80% of the questions identical, but 20% of the questions different from the first test.

## Up to Half

Students have an option to re-take the test, but can only earn extra points that equal 50% of the points missed on the first test (ie, students accrue half-credit on each question answered correctly, if that question was previously missed).

## Group Test / Group Grade

Allow students to take an exam as a team, speaking out loud to each other during the exam (but not so loud that other groups can hear them), and they all share the same grade.

## Group Test / Individual Grade

Allow students to view and discuss the test as a team, but each student fills out an individual test sheet and thus results are not necessarily the same across the entire group

## Group Second-Test

Students take the test individually at first. Then, they take the same test a second time, this time in a group, defending their answers. The individual results should count for more points than the group effort.

## Draw Your Partner

All students draw a number, then find a partner with the same number, and pair up to exchange information in the final few minutes of a test.
