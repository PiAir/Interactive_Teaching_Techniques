# Authorized “Cheating” on In-Class Quizzes 

Note: this stresses practice over summative assessment; term grading schemes should be adjusted to avoid undue grade inflation

## Free Time with Notes

Near the end of the quizzing period, give the students a specific time frame (e.g., 30 seconds) to glance silently at their own notes—this encourages effective note-taking for the future.

## Thy Neighbor’s Notes

Students silently trade notes with a partner and can only use THOSE notes to cheat from (in the final seconds of allowable time).

## Thy Neighbor’s Brain

Students are given some precious seconds to talk to each other, usually done WITHOUT allowing them to access notes. Variation: force the conversations to be in whispers only.

## No Talking!

Students are given a specific time frame to literally compare answers with neighbors. The catch is, the entire experience must be 100% silent—no talking or noises. Gestures and light touching to gain attention are allowed.
